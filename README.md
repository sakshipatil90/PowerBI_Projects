UK-Bank-Customers

I have obtained this dataset form Kaggle. This is in CSV format. However I have converted this to excel format as well.

The Dataset has total 4010 records with 9 columns. This data was collected form United Kingdom.

I have done the analysis and created the dashboard on Power BI.
